## Sum of elements in a list
Define the elements in the list and assign it a variable.
Find the sum of the elements in the list using the sum function.
Display the output using the print function

## Checking if a number is odd or even
Define a function check_even_odd to check if the number is even or odd.
Use an if else statement.
The condition divides the number by two and if the result is zero, then it is even. Otherwise, the number is odd. Place any number to check whether it is even or odd. The output will be displayed.

## Computing a factorial using a loop
Define the function.
Initialize.
Include a for loop, looping from 1 to n + 1.
Display the output.

## Factorial(Recursive)
Define function.
Using the base case confirm if the number is one or zero to return one.
Using the general case, it loops through recursively the number provided until it satisfies the base case.
Using a while loop we retrieve user input and validate if it is a number then feed into the function as an argument otherwise throw an error.

## Reversing a string
Define the function.
A for loop to go through the characters from the end index to the start index.
Add characters to the empty string and finally display the output using the print function.

## Sum of digits of a number
Define the function taking an numerical argument as parameter.
Initialize a total variable that carries the sum of each digit.
Loop through the number converted to a string using a for loop and within the for loop add total to the index of the for loop
Return the total as the result.
